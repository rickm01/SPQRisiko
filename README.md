# SPQRisiko

## Overview

SPQRisiko is a simple android app that helps the management of the board game SPQRisiko.

This app helps the creation of the initial conditions for the start of the game with random provinces distributed to each player. There is also the possibility to give to each player a winning challenge.

### List of functionalities
- Generation of a list of provinces for each player
- Generation of a challenge for each player
- Visualization of all winning challenges
- Language of the app can be changed from settings (only English and Italian available)


### Rules

The rules for the game are similar to the ones of the standard Risiko game with minor changes like winning conditions, initial settings and different type of units.

A detailed version of the rules are in the [SPQRISIKOGAMERULES-en](Rules/SPQRISIKOGAMERULES-en.md).

## Project Status and Next Steps
The app works and all the functionalities are implemented and works properly. The development of the app is now paused and there are missing some graphical updates (e.g. text font does not scale correctly and minor english/italian translations missing).
