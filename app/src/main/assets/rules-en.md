# SPQRISIKO – GAME RULES

## Game components

- 5 armies composed of legionaries, boats, and “flags”.
- One set of “colosseums” (representing “the political power”).
- A game board showing the Roman Empire and a victory score track.
- 6 dice in two colours.
- A deck of 55 special cards.
- A rules booklet.

## Game set-up

- First of all, the players must agree on the number of victory points needed to win the game. There is not a fixed rule. 20 points can be a fair choice.
- Players roll the dice to determine the playing order.
- Depending on the number of players, there will be a different number of neutral armies on the board. The game is always played with 5 different armies, also if the number of players is less than 5.
  - 3 players there are 27 neutral legionaries of one colour and 27 of the second one.
  - With 4 players there are 27 neutral legionaries of one colour. 3 of them must be placed on the province “Rome” (so there are 24 left neutral legionaries).
- To track the score, each player can use a legionary of his own colour. Place them on the 0 space on the score track.

## Starting of the game

Once the previous conditions are met the game can start and the players can start occupying the provinces.
- At your turn, you must place 2 legionaries of your colour on one empty province and 3 neutral legionaries (of the same colour) on another empty province. All the players do the same until no more neutral legionaries are left. From this moment on, simply place your 2 legionaries on an empty province. When all the provinces are occupied by legionaries of different armies, the game can start.
- No boats are placed on sea areas at the beginning of the game. The “colosseums” must be placed close to the board.
- Shuffle the cards and place the deck face down on the table.

## YOUR TURN

During your turn, you can do several actions in the described order.

### 1. Scoring

 1. If you control the greatest “empire”, you score a point. An “empire” is a group of “connected” provinces. It must be greater than 4 provinces and the “islands” don’t count. No points are scored in case of a draw with somebody else.
 2. If you control more provinces than anybody else (it doesn’t matter if they are connected or not), you score one point. No points scored in case of a draw.
 3. You score one point for each “colosseum” inside one of your provinces.
 4. If you control more sea zones than anybody else, you score one point.

### 2. Reinforcements

1. If you have a valid combination of cards you can play them and get the reinforcements. The number and type of reinforcements depends on the combination.
    a) There are 4 symbols: legionary, boat, colosseum and “vexillum” (“flag”).
    b) Three cards with the same symbol grant you 8 legionaries.
    c) Three cards showing three different symbols grant you 10 legionaries.
    d) Each card in the combination showing a “vexillum” gives you 2 extra legionaries.
    e) Each card in the combination showing a boat gives you a boat that must be placed on a sea zone close to a province under your control (if you don’t have a province close to a sea zone you simply lose the extra piece).
    f) Each card in the combination showing a colosseum gives you a colosseum to be placed on a province under your control, but not close to another province with a colosseum (no matter who is the “owner” of the province).
    For example, you can add:
    - 8 units with "three legionaries"
    - 10 + 2 units with "a legionaries,a boat and a vexillum"
    - 8 + 6 units with "three vexilla"
    - 8 units + 3 boats with "three boats"
    - 8 units + 3 colisseums with "three colisseums"
    - ...
2. If you have 3 or more provinces, up to 11, you get 3 legionaries.
3. If you control more than 11 provinces, you get 1 legionary for each 3 provinces (12=4, 13=4, 14=5 and so on).
4. If you control less than 3 provinces you get just one legionary.
5. These legionaries can be placed wherever you like inside your provinces with no restrictions.
6. Any province with a Colosseum generates an extra legionary that must be placed inside that province.
7. You can also “transform” a boat in 2 legionaries to be placed on a province close to the sea zone occupied by the boat.
8. You can transform 3 legionaries into a boat, to be placed inside a sea zone close to the province previously occupied by the legionaries. All the legionaries to be “transformed” must be in the same province.

### 3. Naval Movement

1. Boats are placed inside the sea zones.
2. In the same sea zone there can be boats of different players.
3. During your turn you can move one, some or all the boats that are inside a sea zone to another adjacent one.
4. During your turn you can make a single movement (no matter the number of boats involved).

### 4. Combat

1. The combat rules are the same of Risiko, so I don’t describe them in details. Only remember that the game is based on the italian rules and that means 3 dice as a maximum also for the defender.
2. Land combat is exactly the same as in Risiko, but SPQRisiko has also sea combat and sea landings combats:
3. Sea combats
    a) In any sea zone where you have one or more boats, you can try to sink the boats of one of your enemy (don’t forget that the same sea zone can be occupied by boats of different players).
    b) You declare your intention to attack the enemy fleet and roll the dice (as usual up to three). Your opponent do the same for he’s boats and the score is compared as usual with an exception: draws generate no loss.
    c) The attack can be repeated, but only if the previous one generated at least the loss of one boat (it doesn’t matter if it’s your or enemy’s).
    d) If the combat doesn’t generate any losses it must be stopped.
    e) A player can make a single combat in any sea zone where he has at least one boat and all the sea combat bust take place before any other kind of combat during the turn of a player.
4. Sea landing combat
    a) It is possible to attack an enemy province moving legionaries from a province bordering the same sea zone, but only if the player has more boats in that zone than the owner of the province under attack (see pictures on pag. 10 of the Italian rules booklet). Note that there is no relation between the number of boats the player can have in a sea zone and the number of legionaries that can be “transported”. Also note that you cannot cross with your legionaries more than one sea zone.
    b) A sea landing combat takes place exactly like a land combat, but with an exception. The attacker must declare how many legionaries will be involved in the combat and move them close to the border of the province under attack. From this moment on, the combat will last only with the defeat of one of the two armies involved. The attacker can’t choose to stop rolling the dice until he has conquered the province or lost all his attacking legionaries.
    c) The same province can be attacked in this way only once per turn.

### 5. Garrisons

1. A player cannot voluntarily leave a province bordering with an enemy province with less than 2 legionaries.
2. The only exception to this rule takes place when you move the legionaries involved in the last combat after conquering a province. If you attacked from a province occupied by 4 legionaries and you won, you must move 3 legionaries in the conquered province, leaving just one as a garrison.
3. This rule is applied also to sea landing combat.

### 6. The political power

1. The rebuilding of the political power of the Roman Senate is represented by the “colosseums”.
2. Colosseums belong to the player who controls the province where they have been built.
3. A colosseum can only be built due to a card playing.
4. A colosseum can be placed in any province of the empire, but not adjacent to a province where a colosseum is already present.
5. Any single province can host just one colosseum.
6. Colosseums don’t only give players victory points, they also produce an extra legionary as reinforcement for the player who controls that province.

### 7. Cards

1. Like in the standard Risiko rules, if a player has conquered at least a province during his turn he get a card from the deck.
2. The player can get just one card any turn, it doesn’t matter how many provinces he has conquered.
3. Taking the cards automatically ends the player’s turn.

### 8. Eliminating a player

1. The last province of a player can’t be conquered before the end of the 4th turn.
2. If a player lose his last province, he’s eliminated from the game and all his cards goes to the player who conquered his last province.

### 9. Winning

1. The first player to reach the agreed number of victory points is the winner.
2. In case you decide to end the game after an agreed time limit, the winner is the player with most points when the time’s over.
